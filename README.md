## Requirements

To successfully complete this assignment, you should have the following prerequisites:

- Flutter and Dart installed on your development machine. If you don't have them installed, follow the official Flutter installation guide at [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local development environment:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd WidgetsPractice
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the required dependencies for the project:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `lib/`: This directory contains the Dart source code for the Flutter app.
    - `main.dart`: The entry point of the Flutter app. It contains the `MyApp` widget, which is the root of the app.
    - `greeting_widget.dart`: A Dart file defining a stateless widget called `GreetingWidget` that displays greeting messages.
    - `counter_widget.dart`: A Dart file defining a stateful widget called `CounterWidget` that displays a counter and a button to increment it.

## How to Run

To run the Flutter app on an emulator or a real device, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt**: Navigate to the project directory if you haven't already.

2. **Run the App**: Use the following command to run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   This will build and launch the app on the connected device or emulator.

3. **Test the App**: Once the app is running, you can interact with it. You'll see greeting messages and a counter that you can increment by pressing the "Increment" button.

4. **Customization**: You can customize the app by modifying the code in the `lib/` directory. Adjust the styling, text, and widgets to match your assignment requirements.
